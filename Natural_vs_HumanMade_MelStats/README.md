Run "Compare_groups.m" to obtain main results of the comparison of absolute values and contrast of luminance, melanopsin excitation and ipRGC codification.

Run "Compare_sizes.m" to assess the differences between two sizes of ipRGC receptive fields.

Run "Compare_groups_ips.m" to compare the results of ipRGC 1 and ipRGC 2.

Run "Plot_verification.m" to see how the code responds to artificial images with pure melanopsin or pure luminance changes.

All previous codes used a publicly available hyperspectral images of natural and human-made environments under daylight illumination, previously published by Foster and Nascimento (1,2). This data was obtained through processing of the original hyperspectral data using the code "Mel_stats_main.m" or "create_artificial_scene_main" (folder "generate_verification_hsi"). 

plotMean.m, se_mean.m, and ci_mean.m were provided by Dr. Alexander Schuetz.
