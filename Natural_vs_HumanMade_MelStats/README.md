Run "Compare_groups.m" to obtain main results of the comparison of absolute values and contrast of luminance, melanopsin excitation and ipRGC codification.

Run "Compare_sizes.m" to assess the differences between two sizes of ipRGC receptive fields.

Run "Compare_groups_ips.m" to compare the results of ipRGC 1 and ipRGC 2.

Run "Plot_verification.m" to see how the code responds to artificial images with pure melanopsin or pure luminance changes.

All previous codes use the data in the "Results" folder. This data was obtained through processing of the original hyperspectral data using the code "Mel_stats_main.m" or "create_artificial_scene_main" (folder "generate_verification_hsi").
